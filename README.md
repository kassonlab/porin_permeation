# porin_permeation

This is a collection of scripts to calculate small-molecule permeability through gram-negative outer membrane porins.
These scripts were originally written by Ricardo Ferreira and accompany the following publications:

Simulation-guided engineering of antibiotics for improved bacterial uptake, Ricardo Ferreir
a and Peter Kasson, doi:10.1101/2020.10.08.330332.
Antibiotic Uptake Across Gram-Negative Outer Membranes: Better Predictions Towards Better Antibiotics, Ricardo Ferreira and Peter Kasson, doi:10.1021/acsinfecdis.9b00201.

At current time, the scripts should not be considered robust software but rather illustrative of the approach.
Some manual tweaking may be required to obtain correct umbrella windows for a given simulation, for example.  Please check results carefully.
